The following is the TODO list for Voodoo Tracker.
--------------------------------------------------

Complete source re-organization and code cleanup!

PLAYER: 
	
*	mod.rstchip.09, mod.savage, spotlight madmix, 
	alice d.,abyss-tr -- fix note retriggering 
	when only instrument column is set (this 
	is weird, but I think I found out what it 
	is), there's also some trouble with the 
	3xx command...
*	Find the bug which causes ch->chFinalPitch to become zero
	in tru_funk.mod.
*	What happens if you use 9xx to jump behind the loop end

SAMPLE EDITOR: 

*	Normalize, volume up/down, fade in/out functions.
*	Put back the sample playing monitor ("mixer position").
*	When changing loop points in a sample, retriggering the
	note on the keyboard uses the old loop points --> upload 
	new sample data to driver after editing.
*	Add support for IFF and RAW formats
*	Add Cd-ripping support
* 	Support display window panning (middle mousebutton and
	a hscrollbar under the sample display)
*	Cut, copy & paste support
	
INSTRUMENT EDITOR:

*	Add gtk keyboard widget for managing keyboard split.
*	Add support for loading/saving FT2 instruments
*	Write a gtk+ widget for graphical editing of the
	envelope lists, which should look like the fasttracker2
	envelope editor.
	
VIRTUAL SYNTHS:

*	Add Synth tab
*	Start work on first virtual synth
*	Work on plugin method for additional synths
*	NOTE: Virtual Synths will create sounds to dump into
	the current sample.
	
MIXER:

*	Add mixer tab to notbook.
*	Move volume and pitchblend to mixer tab
*	Add channel panning/volume controls to mixer tab
*	Add clipping indicator to mixer tab
*	Some asm-optimized mixing code would be nice 
	
PREFERENCES: 

*	Remove from notebook and provide it with it's own 
	notebook dialog.Impliment loading and auto saving.
	(gnome_properties_*())

CONTROL PANEL:

*	Use a clist to display and manage the pattern order

SCOPES: 

*	Make it work with large fragsizes

FILE REQUESTER: 

*	Add support for bookmarks/archives.
*	Add file filters
*	Add play button to preview samples
